# 🧠 Customer Segmentation & LTV Dashboard (Power BI)

This project explores customer behavior from an e-commerce dataset to calculate customer value and create actionable segmentation.

## 🔍 Key Objectives:
- Cluster customers using K-Means (Python in Power BI)
- Calculate LTV (Lifetime Value) and AOV (Average Order Value)
- Identify revenue-driving customer groups (VIPs, High Spenders)
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for insights

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Power BI (DAX, Power Query)
- Python (for clustering)
- Excel (preprocessing)
- UCI Online Retail Dataset

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights:
- Line chart: Revenue trends over time by segment
- Map: Customer distribution by region
- Bar/Pie charts: Revenue, AOV, item count by customer group
- KPI Cards: Total revenue, avg. AOV, customer count

## 🤖 Machine Learning:
- Applied K-Means clustering (3–7 segments) based on revenue, AOV, and geography
- Handled nulls, outliers, and normalization inside Power BI

## 📁 Dataset:
